Greetings Traveller,

<br>

The fact that you have stumbled upon this branch of the [World Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) suggests that you are a fellow seeker of the occult knowledge that would bring to end the diabolic organisations that puppet [Midgard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) from the shadows.

<br>

If you are, then why not join us in the battle of Ragnarok. Toghether we shall slay the enemies of the gods. And we shall partake in the feast at Valhalla in the presence of the [Allfather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin).

<br>

[Operation Mímir](/) is the an attempt by those who still dare to rebel, to make this knowledge more accessible. Named after the all-knowing [Mímir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%ADmir), whose severed head imparted boundless wisdom to Odin himself; this website aims to impart wisdom to all.

<br> 

Why, you ask?

<br>

Because knowledge is power. And in these tumultuous times, power is the weapon with which we shall stave off the apocalypse.

<br>

Heed this call to arms, for the knowledge contained within these digital pages is the key to our [salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia). Embrace the wisdom of Mímir, and stand with us against the encroaching darkness. The fate of the world rests in the balance, and your pursuit of truth is our greatest weapon.

<br>

Join us, brave scholar, and let us illuminate the path to a brighter, wiser future.

<br>
